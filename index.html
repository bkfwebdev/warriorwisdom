<div id="intro-paragraph">
<p>Throughout human history there has been warrior culture, a culture that emphasizes mastery of self in order to deal with the challenges of a changing environment.
 In every part of the globe from Africa, to Europe, to Asia, and even The Americas there has been a culture of warriorship passed down from master to disciple.
 Included in these skills were various methods of armed and unarmed combat. Through the study of these skills were are able to maximize mental and physical integration as well as gaining an increased ability to protect our families, 
 loved ones, homes, and property from the negative elements of society.At Warrior Wisdom Martial Arts it is our mission to research, cultivate, and disperse this transformational knowledge.
 We emphasize one on one private instruction so that the specific needs of each student can be met. In each one hour session you will have
direct contact with a master instructor,as a result you will excel rapidly and gain practical skill very quickly. Warrior Wisdom is the knowledge gained through the experience of self-mastery, we use martial arts as the method for gaining that experience.</p>

 <h2> Our Training Philosophy </h2>
<p> Martial arts training provides a path to self mastery and the opportunity to change your nature, if you are willing to do the work.
Our curriculum is taught with the understanding that the student MUST do the work, for each one hour private lesson the student is expected to do
a minimum of 5 hours of training and study on his or her own. We are not giving you something that you can put in your pocket and walk away with
or something that you can put on like a shirt. We are offering truly transformational knowledge that must be digested and absorbed in order
for it to be of any real use. It would be a waste of time to engage in this as casual study, if you are serious then I believe we have what you're looking for. 
The door is open, the path awaits.</p>
