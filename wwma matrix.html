<p> The Weapon Matrix curriculum gives the student the ability to deploy a weapon an edged or impact weapon in each hand. 
The material is taken primarily from Sinawali, using waeving multiple strike patterns, disarms and finishing techniques.
This course requires a high degree of skill,dexterity, and coordination; it is recommended that students take one of the 
single weapon courses prior to attempting this course.</p>

<p>Think of all the great systems of the Pacific and the best things inside them! Karate from Japan. Kali Silat from Indonesia. Arnis, Filipino Stick Fighting, Escrima from the Philippines. Hawaii's conversion of Kenpo / Kenpo. Kajukenbo. Warlike tactics of the Polynesian peoples who explored and settled so much of the Pacific. The Ring of Fire! This region's history of military conflicts, each one is better than the other in different ways. It has always been this bigger Pacific collective of hand, stick and knife martial that I have loved. Never just one system. Hybrid practitioners-free thinking experts from several systems-simply produce the best fighters. The very foundation of this course is based upon that principle, to produce that type of free, hybrid fighter.</p>
