<p> Many martial arts systems emphasize and train the ability to sense energy, direction, and intent based on tactile sensation from any limb to limb contact.
There are a variety of methods used to develops theses skills, such as Push Hands, Sticking Hands, Rolling Hands, Spinning Hands, from Chinese martial arts as well as drill such as Hubud from Filipino martial arts.
These drills are useful in giving you the ability to use positional and mechanical advantages to set up strikes,follow ups, joint locks, and throws.
These skills in and of themselves will not make you a great fighter but they will give a significant advantage in a variety of combat scenarios.

<p>Ving Tsun ("Wing Chun") Kung Fu is a martial art developed at China's southern Shaolin Temple. It emphasizes close quarters combat, the application of sound principles, and the development of attributes and skills as opposed to specific techniques. The legend of Ving Tsun states that it was founded roughly 400 years ago by a female Shaolin monk named Ng Mui after she observed a snake and a crane engaged in combat. She first taught this new system to a young girl named Yim Ving Tsun, and so named the system after her. Ving Tsun does not require more than average strength and can be practiced well into one's later years. It develops relaxation, coordination, balance, timing, and sensitivity. With Ving Tsun training we realize that skilled technique based on sound principles can conquer brute strength.</p>
